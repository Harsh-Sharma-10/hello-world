Here I am using Git
Now First you have to clone the repository from github
Why Clone ? If you want to contributes in someones project, in that project you have to search for a directory where you thought there is some changes is required First you take this project form github to your local machine for do the changes.
there is you required clone
git clone linkofproject

git status

If you found a directory where you are able to apply changes if it is required
then first you go into that directory by cd command
cd filename-whereyou have to do the changes
then check git status

now if it is fine then you run git add command

git add index.html  ///for example

git add README.md  

git add .

Now we have to commit the changes

git commit -m "Here I write some description about commands"
Now Finally we push this project form our local machine into git

git push origin main
